# Vimzo Assignment Blog App

Welcome to the Vimzo Assignment Blog App! This is a simple blogging application built for an assignment at Vimzo. This application allows users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts.

## About

This project is a React application that simulates a blogging platform. It uses local storage to store blog post data, which means that no external database is required. This makes the setup process simple and eliminates the need for server-side infrastructure.

## Installation

To run the Vimzo Assignment Blog App locally on your machine, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vimzo-assignment-blog-app.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd vimzo-assignment-blog-app
  ```

3. Install dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
     npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
     npm start
   ```
## Usage
Upon starting the application, you'll notice that the site looks empty. This is because the blog posts are stored locally and there are currently no blog posts created. To create a blog post, follow these steps:

1. Click on the "+" button in the top right corner of the page.
2. Fill out the form to create a new blog post.
3. Click on the "Create" button to save the blog post.
4. Once you've created a blog post, you can view it by clicking on its title from the main page. You can also edit or delete the blog post from the view page.

That's it! You're now ready to explore and use the Vimzo Assignment Blog App.
